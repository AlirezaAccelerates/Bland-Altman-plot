# Bland-Altman Plot

This repository contains a Python function to create a Bland-Altman plot, which is commonly used to analyze the agreement between two different measurement methods. The plot helps visualize the bias (mean difference) and the limits of agreement between the two datasets.

## Features
- Calculates the mean difference, standard deviation, and root mean square error (RMSE) of the differences between two datasets.
- Plots the Bland-Altman chart with limits of agreement (mean Â± 1.96 * SD).
- Automatically annotates the chart with the mean difference and limits.
- Returns key statistical metrics for further analysis.

## Installation

You will need the following libraries to run the code:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install them via pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
To generate a Bland-Altman plot, simply call the `bland_altman_plot` function with two datasets as input:

```python
data1 = [values1]  # Your first dataset
data2 = [values2]  # Your second dataset

mean_diff, std_diff, rmse, upper_limit, lower_limit, max_abs_limit = bland_altman_plot(data1, data2)
```
